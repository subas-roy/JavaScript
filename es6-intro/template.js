// TEMPLATE LITERALS are enclosed by backtick(``) characters instead of single or double quotes, allowing for the following:

// Multiline String
const email = `Hi, John
Good Afternoon, how are you?`;
console.log(email);


// String Interpulation
const a = 10;
const b = 20;
const sum = `Sum of ${a} and ${b} is: ${a+b}`;
console.log(sum);
